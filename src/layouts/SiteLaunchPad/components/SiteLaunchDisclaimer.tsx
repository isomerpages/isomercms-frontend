        Site launch is the process of connecting your Isomer site to a domain,
        and making it publicly available on the internet. You will need to do
        this using your service provider for your name server, which is separate
        from Isomer. Typically, this would be the IT Service Management (ITSM).

      <Text textStyle="body-2" mb="2rem">
        Isomer provides the credentials you need to add or change in your name
        server (typically ITSM),{" "}
        <Text as="b">but cannot update them on your behalf.</Text>However, you
        can come back here after updating the credentials, to check if your
        website is launched and publicly accessible.

            Site launch is a time-sensitive process and often requires
            coordination between multiple parties (e.g. IT administrator, CWP
            contact, the agency&apos;s launch approver). We recommend scheduling
            a launch date when all these individuals are available.

            The Isomer team is available to assist with launch only between
            10:30 am and 4:30 pm (Monday to Friday), so we recommend planning
            your launch during these hours. Any launch issues outside these
            hours will be attended to during working hours.

            Expect at least 1 hour of downtime for your site during launch. If
            not coordinated properly, your site could be down for as long as 48
            hours.

            If you are unfamiliar with site launches, we recommend getting
            someone from your IT team to launch your site for you. You can add
            them as a collaborator to your site, and remove them after it has
            been launched.
